	<h1> Rap God Lyrics</h1>
	<p>[Intro]<br>
"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."<br>
"But I'm only going to get this one chance." (Six minutes— Six minutes—)<br>
"Something's wrong, I can feel it." (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)<br>
"Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.<br> 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; <br>
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."<br>
"You are just what the doc ordered."<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?<br>
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes<br>
I got a laptop in my back pocket<br>
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it<br>
Got a fat knot from that rap profit<br>
Made a livin' and a killin' off it<br>
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office<br>
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack<br>
I'm an MC still as honest<br>
But as rude and as indecent as all hell<br>
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)<br>
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop<br>
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match<br>
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'<br>
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack<br>
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that<br>
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table<br>
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half<br>
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact<br>
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs<br>
Feel my wrath of attack<br>
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad<br>
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack<br>
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?<br>
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard<br>
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's<br>
Simply rage and youthful exuberance<br>
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance<br>
Hit the Earth like an asteroid<br>
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)<br>
MCs get taken to school with this music<br>
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"<br>
Now I lead a new school full of students<br>
Me? I'm a product of Rakim<br>
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren<br>
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim<br>
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position<br>
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them<br>
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame<br>
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames<br>
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame<br>
On the wall of shame<br>
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames<br>
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?<br>
Little gay-lookin' boy<br>
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)<br>
You're witnessin' a mass-occur<br>
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy<br>
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy<br>
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back<br>
And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy<br>
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?<br>
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy<br>
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit<br>
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!<br>
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable<br>
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br>
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br>
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR<br>
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God<br>
Kneel before General Zod<br>
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin<br>
You rodent, I'm omnipotent<br>
Let off, then I'm reloadin'<br>
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'<br>
And I should not be woken<br>
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'<br>
But I got your mom deep-throatin'<br>
I'm out my Ramen Noodle<br>
We have nothin' in common, poodle<br>
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil<br>
It's me, my honesty's brutal<br>
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though<br>
For good at least once in a while<br>
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes<br>
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times<br>
But I gotta keep a few punchlines<br>
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned<br>
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime<br>
I know there was a time where once I<br>
Was king of the underground<br>
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind<br>
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine<br>
Appeal with the skin color of mine<br>
You get too big and here they come tryin'<br>
To censor you like that one line<br>
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I<br>
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine<br>
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9<br>
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm<br>
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal<br>
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though<br>
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for<br>
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows<br>
You write normal? Fuck being normal!<br>
And I just bought a new raygun from the future<br>
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad<br>
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad<br>
Singin' to a man while he played piano<br>
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel<br>
So Ray J went straight to the radio station<br>
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"<br>
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)<br>
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human<br>
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?<br>
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and<br>
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating<br>
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating<br>
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting<br>
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating<br>
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated<br>
I make elevating music, you make elevator music<br>
"Oh, he's too mainstream."<br>
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it<br>
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it<br>
With rock, shock rap with Doc<br>
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it<br>
"I don't know how to make songs like that<br>
I don't know what words to use."<br>
Let me know when it occurs to you<br>
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you<br>
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you<br>
How many verses I gotta murder to<br>
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!<br>
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie<br>
But look at the accolades these skills brung me<br>
Full of myself, but still hungry<br>
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to<br>
And I'm a million leagues above you<br>
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you<br>
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel<br>
I'ma sleep in the front seat<br>
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"<br>
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling<br>
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me<br>
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate<br>
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred<br>
I have, then you may be a little patient<br>
And more sympathetic to the situation<br>
And understand the discrimination<br>
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!<br>
But if I can't batter the women<br>
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!<br>
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake<br>
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation<br>
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and<br>
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not<br>
Why be a king when you can be a God?</p>
