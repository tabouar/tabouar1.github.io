<p>[Intro]<br>
Ugh, you're a monster<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Eminem]<br>
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla<br>
Better hit the deck like the card dealer<br>
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party<br>
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby "The<br>
Brain" Heenan which is probably the<br>
Same reason I wrestle with mania<br>
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up<br>
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake<br>
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia<br>
ADHD, Hydroxycut<br>
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)<br>
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate<br>
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)<br>
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A<br>
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames<br>
They cannot tame or placate the<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]<br>
Monster<br>
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)<br>
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)<br>
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers<br>
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters<br>
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster<br>
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet<br>
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster<br>
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Eminem]<br>
I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls<br>
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off<br>
It's impossible to list 'em all<br>
And in the midst of all this<br>
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball<br>
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?<br>
Risperdal, voices whisper<br>
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn<br>
This is just the song to go ballistic on<br>
You just pulled a pistol on a guy with a missile launcher<br>
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological<br>
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka<br>
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]<br>
Monster<br>
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)<br>
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)<br>
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers<br>
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters<br>
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster<br>
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet<br>
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster<br>
Blood on the dance floor, and Louis V carpet<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Eminem]<br>
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand<br>
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans<br>
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is<br>
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)<br>
How can I have all these fans and perspire?<br>
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire<br>
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire<br>
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer<br>
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers<br>
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw<br>
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball<br>
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy<br>
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)<br>
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher<br>
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care<br>
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her<br>
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez<br>
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well<br>
So they wanna give me the chair<br>
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari<br>
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em<br>
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious<br>
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column<br>
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem<br>
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)<br>
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink<br>
Evil half of the Bad Meets<br>
Evil, that means take a back seat<br>
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single<br>
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people<br>
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle<br>
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto<br>
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em<br>
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em<br>
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage<br>
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade<br>
I'm fittin' to kill 'em and dumpin' their fuckin' bodies in the lake<br>
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade<br>
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid<br>
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway<br>
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill<br>
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla<br>
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me<br>
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me<br>
Or be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be<br>
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter<br>
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck<br>
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me<br>
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me<br>
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable<br>
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blown up like an inflatable<br>
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable<br>
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full<br>
I'm not afraid to pull a—<br>

[Outro: Eminem]<br>
Man, stop<br>
Look what I'm plannin', haha</p><br>
