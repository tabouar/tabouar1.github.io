	<h1> My Name Is Lyrics</h1>
	<p>[Produced by Dr. Dre]<br>

[Chorus: Eminem]<br>
<br>
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]<br>
Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)<br>
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)<br>
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)<br>
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)<br>
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight<br>
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)<br>
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady, you a basehead" (Uh-uh)<br>
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted"<br>
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else<br>
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt<br>
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off<br>
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross<br>
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass<br>
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast<br>
Come here, slut; "Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg"<br>
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Eminem]<br>
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Eminem]<br>
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)<br>
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35<br>
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler<br>
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)<br>
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up<br>
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup<br>
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, "Let's just be friends"<br>
99 percent of my life, I was lied to<br>
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)<br>
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper<br>
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her<br>
(Oh, thank you)<br>
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands<br>
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans<br>
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)<br>
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)<br>
So I signed it, "Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Eminem]<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
<br>
[Verse 3: Eminem]<br>
Stop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)<br>
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate<br>
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)<br>
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive<br>
(Huh, yup)<br>
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide<br>
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)<br>
All my life I was very deprived<br>
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)<br>
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk<br>
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)<br>
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits<br>
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits<br>
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed<br>
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)<br>
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)<br>
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)<br>
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Eminem]<br>
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?<br>
My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady<br>
